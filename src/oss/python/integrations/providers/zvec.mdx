title: Zvec
---

> [Zvec](https://zvec.org/en/) is an open-source, in-process vector database — lightweight, lightning-fast, and designed to embed directly into applications. Built on Proxima (Alibaba's battle-tested vector search engine), it delivers production-grade, low-latency, scalable similarity search with minimal setup

This document demonstrates to leverage Zvec within the LangChain ecosystem. In particular, it shows how to install Zvec, and how to use it as a VectorStore plugin in LangChain.

## Installation and setup

Install the Python SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install zvec
```

```bash uv
uv add zvec
```
</CodeGroup>


## Embedding models

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import DashScopeEmbeddings
```

See the [use example](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/zvec).

## Vector store

A Zvec Collection is wrapped as a familiar VectorStore for native usage within LangChain, which allows it to be readily used for various scenarios, such as semantic search or example selection.

You may import the vectorstore by:

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Zvec
```

For a detailed walkthrough of the Zvec wrapper, please refer to [this notebook](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/zvec)
