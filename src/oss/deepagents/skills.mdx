description: Learn how to extend your deep agent's capabilities with skills
---

You can use [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) to provide your deep agent with new capabilities and expertise.

## What are skills

Skills are a directory of folders, where each folder has one or more files that contain context the agent can use:

- a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and metadata about the skill
- additional scripts (optional)
- additional reference info, such as docs (optional)
- additional assets, such as templates and other resources (optional)

## How do skills work

When you create a deep agent, you can pass in a list of directories containing skills.
As the agent starts, it reads through the frontmatter of each `SKILL.md` file.

When the agent receives a prompt, the agent checks if it can use any skills while fulfilling the prompt.
If it finds a matching prompt, it then reviews the rest of the skill files.
This pattern of only reviewing the skill information when needed is called progressive disclosure.

## Examples

You might have a skills folder that contains a skill to use a docs site in a certain way, as well as another skill to search the arXiv preprint repository of research papers:

```plaintext
    skills/
    ├── langgraph-docs
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── arxiv_search
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── arxiv_search.ts # code for searchign arXiv
```

The `SKILL.md` file always follows the same pattern, starting with metadata in the frontmatter and followed by the instructions for the skill.
The following example shows a skill that gives instructions on how to provide relevant langgraph docs when prompted:

```md
---
name: langgraph-docs
description: Use this skill for requests related to LangGraph in order to fetch relevant documentation to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.
---

# langgraph-docs

## Overview

This skill explains how to access LangGraph Python documentation to help answer questions and guide implementation.

## Instructions

### 1. Fetch the Documentation Index

Use the fetch_url tool to read the following URL:
https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt

This provides a structured list of all available documentation with descriptions.

### 2. Select Relevant Documentation

Based on the question, identify 2-4 most relevant documentation URLs from the index. Prioritize:

- Specific how-to guides for implementation questions
- Core concept pages for understanding questions
- Tutorials for end-to-end examples
- Reference docs for API details

### 3. Fetch Selected Documentation

Use the fetch_url tool to read the selected documentation URLs.

### 4. Provide Accurate Guidance

After reading the documentation, complete the user's request.
```

## Usage

Pass the skills directory when creating your deep agent:

:::python

with urlopen(skill_url) as response:
    skill_content = response.read().decode('utf-8')

skills_files = {
    "/skills/langgraph-docs/SKILL.md": skill_content
}

agent = create_deep_agent(
    skills=["./skills/"],
    checkpointer=checkpointer,

store.put(
    namespace=("filesystem",),
    key="/skills/langgraph-docs/SKILL.md",
    value=skill_content

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=(lambda rt: StoreBackend(rt)),
    store=store,
    skills=["./skills/"]
)

            }
        ]
    },
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "12345"}},
)
```

```python FilesystemBackend
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from deepagents.backends.filesystem import FilesystemBackend

# Checkpointer is REQUIRED for human-in-the-loop
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=FilesystemBackend(root_dir="/Users/user/{project}"),
    skills=["/Users/user/{project}/skills/"],
    interrupt_on={
        "write_file": True,  # Default: approve, edit, reject
        "read_file": False,  # No interrupts needed
        "edit_file": True    # Default: approve, edit, reject
    },
    checkpointer=checkpointer,  # Required!
)

result = agent.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [

                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is langgraph?",
            }
        ]
    },
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "12345"}},
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<ParamField body="skills" type="list[str]" optional>
    List of skill source paths. Paths must be specified using forward slashes and are relative to the backend's root.
    - When using StateBackend (default), provide skill files with `invoke(files={...})`.
    - With FilesystemBackend, skills are loaded from disk relative to the backend's root_dir.

    Later sources override earlier ones for skills with the same name (last one wins).

## When to use skills and tools

These are a few general guidelines for using tools and skills:

- Use skills when there is a lot of context to reduce the number of tokens in the system prompt.
- Use skills to bundle capabilities together into larger actions and provide additional context beyond single tool descriptions.
- Use tools if the agent does not have access to the file system.
